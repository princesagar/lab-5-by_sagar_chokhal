Qno1:To solve this  question I have created 2 function one is to show the image on clicking the show
button and another one to hide the image on clicking the hide button and inside hide function we have to set the visibility
to hidden to hide img and inside the show function we have to set the visibility to visible so that it can be visible to the user

Qno2:In this question I have created two img one is baby's img and another one is nature's img with appropriate height and
width and two function are created  and on clicking the img it will call the function having that id assigned to that function

Qno3:I have created one paragraph having id "myid" and after that I created one function inside the script tag which 
contain the paragraph to be shown to the user after click the button and button shows the containt of the function 
because I have used onclick="myfunc()"so it will call the myfunc().

Qno4:The ondragstart attribute calls a function, drag(event), that specifies what data to be dragged.
The dataTransfer.setData() method sets the data type and the value of the dragged data.

Qno5:To solve this question I have created a function inside the script tag and declared a variable  "a" which holds the 
data entered by the user if the user doesnot enter any value then a will be null due to this if condition will not be satisfied
and on submitting it will alert a message "your must enter your name!!!"
